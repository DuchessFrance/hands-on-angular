  /**
   * 1. The entrypoint of your angular app is your HTML. No tests will be done on the Javascript.
   * First of all, we need to initialize an Angular app (see `client/app.js`). To do so, a angular module has been created (`angular.module(moduleName, externalModules[])` for creation, then `angular.module(moduleName)` to access it [doc](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module))
   * Angular has been created to allow multiple modules to work along. In fact, it never happens to have more than one module for a given app
   * Note that ng is the diminutive of Angular, so to bind your newly created JS app with your HTML, create on a top level HTML tag (`body`, `html`) a `ng-app`attribute with a value corresponding to your module name (here `myHandsOn`)
   * By doing this, you allow Angular to take control of the tags contained by the `ng-app` tag to extend the original HTML tag and add its own `ng-*` tags
   * You also let angular take control of {{}} data (data-binded values, {{ is called a mustache)
   * An Angular app creates a namespace named `$rootScope`. It is considered as a bad practice to interact with the $rootScope (or for certain reasons, like we'll see further)
   * To checks if it works, open your browser console and check if there is a "It works" logged in. This log is fired from the `.run` block of your application, so when the bootstrap of your application is done and when it starts to run.
   * Note also that ' (single quotes) are used in JS, " (double quotes) in HTML

  /**
   * 1. Create a controller attribute on a lower level HTML tag, in your angular app (so in a tag contained by your angular app tag)
   * It will create a more localized namespace where you'll be able to plug your application data stores and service to your view
   * Note that a controller has a namespace name `$scope`, which is directly available in the view.
   * The value of the `ng-controller` attribute is the name of the controller like defined in your Angular module (here, it is `HomeController`). Since XXXController is a quite long apellation, you can specify an alias by using `as XXX`. In your controller, when you then use `XXX`, it refers to your controller and to what you put in it, using `this` on the JS part
   * 2. Create your JS controller on your angular module. `angular.module` returns your module, so, like the `.run`, add a `.controller`. The basic API is `module.controller(controllerName, arrayContainingTheInjectedNamesAndTheInjectionFunction)`, but ngAnnotate allows us to simply use `module.controller(controllerName, injectionFunction)`
   * The injection function is dependency injection. Each parameter is the name of an injected service (like `$rootScope` or `$scope`). For now, it is empty, since no services are needed.
   * In your injection function, you can add some code that will be run when the controller is created, like a log.

Quite convenient, isn't it?
