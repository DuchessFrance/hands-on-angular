  /**
   * Let's start some big refactoring
   * An Angular app is a Single Page App (SPA), which means that in opposition to standard client/server interaction where each click generates a new response of the server to create the asked resource, all the application layout and navigation is loaded on the run of a SPA.
   * Routing is no more handled by the server, but by Angular. In that way, we're gonna refactor our rising application with one page to be ready to have ... two pages.
   * There are two well-known routing angular plugin that can be used: ng-route and ui-router. The first one is edited by Angular team. The second one by the UI team. We're gonna use ui-router.
   * It has already been loaded on the `lib` folder by the build system (step 1 on [ui-router's doc](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)).
   * 1. Load `lib\angular-ui-router.js` between Angular and your app (step 2 on [ui-router's doc](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)).
   * 2. Tell your application to use this plugin by setting it on your `app.js`. `angular.module(appName, extModuleNames)` is perfect to do so. For now, `angular.module('myHandsOn', [])` has no dependency, as you can see with this second argument that is an empty array. To add ui-router as a dependency, checks [ui-router repository](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)'s step 3.
   * Now, we're gonna use ui-router with our single page
   * 3. In `index.html`, determine which part is static and which is dynamic
   * 4. Create a `home` folder at the root of your project. All home related features, controllers and views will be found in this folder
   * 5. Create a `home\home.html` file and copy inside your dynamic part of your `index.html`. Check that your dynamic part has the `ng-controller` tag inside
   * 6. Create a `home\home.js` file. Copy in it your `HomeController`. The `.controller` function must be invocated from the app module. To get it, use `angular.module(appName)`. Note that without a second argument, the `angular.module` function behave like a getter, but with a second argument, it's a setter. It's due to jQuery legacy (after all, angular use jQlite, which is a light jQuery). No need to load your `home\homeController.js` file, it's already done by the build system which concatenate and ngAnnotate it in the generated `app.js`.
   * 7. In `index.html`, replace your dynamic HTML a '<div ui-view></div>' like in [ui-router's doc, step 2](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router#nested-states--views)
   * 8. As described in [ui-router's doc, step 5](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router#nested-states--views), in your `app.js`, add a new `.config(injectionFunction)` block, where you inject `$urlRouterProvider`. Define your default route to `/` using `$urlRouterProvider.otherwise(route)`, since no 404 have been set for now.
   * 9. In your `home.js`, as described in [ui-router's doc, step 5](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router#nested-states--views), add a new `.config(injectionFunction)` block, where you inject `$stateProvider`. Define your first state `home`, by setting its URL to `/` and its template to `home/home.html`.
   * Fine! There is no more features, but it's a better base to add new pages
